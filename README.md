# Swift

## Project Overview
The Swift project contains the full research of our demo paper and a dataset of national flight data.

## File Structure
- **Swifty-Full Research Paper.pdf**: The full research of the demo paper we submitted.
- **data/**: A folder containing the dataset of national flight data.

## Usage Instructions
- **Swifty-Full Research Paper.pdf**: You can read our paper to learn more about the demo's details and results.
- **data/**: This folder contains relevant files of the national flight dataset. We crawled 98,158 flight records from WebXml [http://www.webxml.com.cn/webservices] as the large-scale dataset. This dataset covers 52 different airplane types from 29 Chinese airlines. Each file in the dataset represents flights of the same airplane type, with nodes containing fields as: `"AIRLINE_CODE"`, `"FLIGHT_ID"`, `"DEPARTURE_AIRPORT"`, `"ARRIVAL_AIRPORT"`, `"TIME_DEPARTURE"`, `"TIME_ARRIVAL"`, `"CITY_DEPARTURE"`, `"CITY_ARRIVAL"`, and `"MODE"`.
